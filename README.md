# MAD
Some functions to help with math for data analisis...\n
Note that all the results are approximated to 2 digits after decimal point. \n
I've included a basic main.cpp file showing some functionalities. \n

To compile use: g++ main.cpp functions.cpp (be sure to have all 3 files in the same folder)
